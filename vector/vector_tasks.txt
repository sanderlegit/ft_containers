Member functions
(constructor)		Construct vector (public member function )			-all but range written,tested
(destructor)		Vector destructor (public member function )			-written, seems alright
operator=			Assign content (public member function )			-written,tested

Iterators:
begin				Return iterator to beginning (public member function )
end					Return iterator to end (public member function )
rbegin				Return reverse iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )
rend				Return reverse iterator to reverse end (public member function )

Capacity:
size				Return size (public member function )									-written,tested
max_size			Return maximum size (public member function )							-written,tested
resize				Change size (public member function )									-written,tested
capacity			Return size of allocated storage capacity (public member function )		-written,tested
empty				Test whether vector is empty (public member function )					-written,tested
reserve				Request a change in capacity (public member function )					-written,tested

Element access:
operator[]			Access element (public member function )			-written,tested
at					Access element (public member function )			-written,tested
front				Access first element (public member function )		-written,tested
back				Access last element (public member function )		-written,tested

Modifiers:
assign				Assign vector content (public member function )
push_back			Add element at the end (public member function )		-written,tested
pop_back			Delete last element (public member function )			-written,tested
insert				Insert elements (public member function )
erase				Erase elements (public member function )
swap				Swap content (public member function )					-written,tested		TODO- check iterator validity
clear				Clear content (public member function )					-written,tested

Non-member function overloads
relational operators		Relational operators for vector (function template )	-start here today :)
swap						Exchange contents of vectors (function template )		-written,tested	TODO- check iterator validity

Template specializations
vector<bool>				Vector of bool (class template specialization )
