states 	[proto, partial, written, buggy, tested]

(constructor)		Construct list (public member function )			-written,tested
(destructor)		List destructor (public member function )			-written,tested
operator=			Assign content (public member function )			-written,tested

	Iterators:				(all have const and non const)
begin				Return iterator to beginning (public member function )						-written,tested	no const test
end					Return iterator to end (public member function )							-written,tested	no assignments!!
rbegin				Return reverse iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )		-written,tested	no -> (needs class)
rend				Return reverse iterator to reverse end (public member function )			-written,tested

	Capacity:
empty				Test whether container is empty (public member function )	-written,tested
size				Return size (public member function )						-written,tested
max_size			Return maximum size (public member function )				-written,tested

	Element access:			(all have const and non const)
front				Access first element (public member function )		-written,tested
back				Access last element (public member function )		-written,tested

	Modifiers:
assign				Assign new content to container (public member function )		-written,tested
push_front			Insert element at beginning (public member function )			-written,tested
pop_front			Delete first element (public member function )					-written,tested
push_back			Add element at the end (public member function )				-written,tested
pop_back			Delete last element (public member function )					-written,tested
insert				Insert elements (public member function )						-written,tested
erase				Erase elements (public member function )						-written,tested		(maybe double check tomorrow)
swap				Swap content (public member function )							-written,tested

	Operations:
splice				Transfer elements from list to list (public member function )				-written,tested
remove				Remove elements with specific value (public member function )				-written,tested
remove_if			Remove elements fulfilling condition (public member function template )		-written,tested
unique				Remove duplicate values (public member function )							-written,tested
merge				Merge sorted lists (public member function )								-written,tested
sort				Sort elements in container (public member function )						-written,tested
reverse				Reverse the order of elements (public member function )						-written,tested

	Non-member function overloads:
relational operators (list)		Relational operators for list (function )
swap (list)						Exchanges the contents of two lists (function template )


a null iterator is given if .begin is called on an empty list, is this expected behaviour?

check sort stability
	sort with a struct pair, sorting with one side
		add an overload for <, >, ==
	add some duplicate elements (sort side), with unique unsorted side
	check as usual
but i probably wont because i know bubble sort is stable

do all operations have tests with size 1, size 0??
