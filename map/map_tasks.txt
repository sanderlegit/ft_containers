plan:
empty constructor		done
insert
iterator :				done
	i++
	*i
begin
end


iterator++ algo:
	if right node
		go right
		while (left)
			visited paretn = 0
			go left
	else
		go to parent

keep a stack of visted nodes, pointers to unwritten parents, flag for parent written in node??
something to check wether a parent has been visited or not

begin()
	while n->left
		n = n->left
	return iterator(n);
