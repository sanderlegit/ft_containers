states 	[proto, partial, written, buggy, tested]

(constructor)		Construct list (public member function )			-written,	tested
(destructor)		List destructor (public member function )			-written,	tested
operator=			Assign content (public member function )			-written,	tested

	Iterators:				(all have const and non const)
begin				Return iterator to beginning (public member function )						-written,	tested			no test written for const versions!!!
end					Return iterator to end (public member function )							-written,	tested			no assignments!!
rbegin				Return reverse iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )		-written,	tested			no -> checks (needs classes)
rend				Return reverse iterator to reverse end (public member function )			-written,	tested

	Capacity:
empty				Test whether container is empty (public member function )	-written,	tested
size				Return size (public member function )						-written,	tested
max_size			Return maximum size (public member function )				-written,	tested

	Element access:			(all have const and non const)
front				Access first element (public member function )		-written,	tested
back				Access last element (public member function )		-written,	tested

	Modifiers:
assign				Assign new content to container (public member function )
push_front			Insert element at beginning (public member function )			-written
pop_front			Delete first element (public member function )					-written
push_back			Add element at the end (public member function )				-written
pop_back			Delete last element (public member function )					-written
insert				Insert elements (public member function )
erase				Erase elements (public member function )
swap				Swap content (public member function )
resize				Change size (public member function )
clear				Clear content (public member function )

	Operations:
splice				Transfer elements from list to list (public member function )
remove				Remove elements with specific value (public member function )
remove_if			Remove elements fulfilling condition (public member function template )
unique				Remove duplicate values (public member function )
merge				Merge sorted lists (public member function )
sort				Sort elements in container (public member function )
reverse				Reverse the order of elements (public member function )

	Non-member function overloads:
relational operators (list)		Relational operators for list (function )
swap (list)						Exchanges the contents of two lists (function template )


fixed so that base points at head and tail, and vice versa
	need exhaustive tests for end, rend
