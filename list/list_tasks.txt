states 	[proto, partial, written, buggy, tested]

(constructor)		Construct list (public member function )			-written,tested

operator=			Assign content (public member function )			-written,tested

	Iterators:				(all have const and non const)
begin				Return iterator to beginning (public member function )						-written,tested	no const test
end					Return iterator to end (public member function )							-written,tested	no assignments!!
rbegin				Return reverse iterator to reverse beginning (public member function )		-written,tested	no -> (needs class)
rend				Return reverse iterator to reverse end (public member function )			-written,tested

	Capacity:
empty				Test whether container is empty (public member function )	-written,tested
size				Return size (public member function )						-written,tested
max_size			Return maximum size (public member function )				-written,tested

	Element access:			(all have const and non const)

pop_back			Delete last element (public member function )					-written,tested
insert				Insert elements (public member function )						-written,tested
erase				Erase elements (public member function )						-written,tested		(maybe double check tomorrow)

reverse				Reverse the order of elements (public member function )

	Non-member function overloads:
relational operators (list)		Relational operators for list (function )
swap (list)						Exchanges the contents of two lists (function template )


a null iterator is given if .begin is called on an empty list, is this expected behaviour?
base is not explicitely deleted in destructor
